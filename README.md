# Ansible MCP Builder Collection

The Ansible MCP Builder collection provides automated deployment and management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers within Ansible Execution Environments.

## Description

The `ansible.mcp_builder` collection provides roles to build and install MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers from various sources including npm, PyPI, and source builds. It features a unified registry system for server details, and automatically generates a manifest file for easy server execution via the [ansible.mcp collection](https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.mcp).

This collection is designed for Ansible automation users who want to integrate MCP servers into their automation workflows using Ansible Execution Environments (EEs). The collection simplifies the deployment process by handling dependencies, installation paths, and server configuration, allowing you to focus on using MCP servers rather than managing their setup.

## Requirements

**ansible-core**: 2.16.0+

**Python**: 3.11+

**Collections**:
  - `ansible.mcp` for execution of MCP servers.

**External dependencies**:
  - `ansible-builder` for building Execution Environments
  - `podman` or `docker` for container runtime
  - Fedora/RHEL base image for use in Execution Environment builds

## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.mcp_builder
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: ansible.mcp_builder
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.mcp_builder --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection. Use the following syntax to install version 1.0.0:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.mcp_builder:==1.0.0
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Use Cases

### 1. Building an Execution Environment (EE) with MCP Servers

The `ansible.mcp_builder` collection is designed to run as a step in building an Execution Environment (EE), allowing you to deploy multiple MCP servers from various sources (npm packages, PyPI packages, and compiled Go binaries) in a single environment.

The collection must be listed as a `galaxy` dependency in the `execution-environment.yml` file, either directly listed or passed via a `requirements.yml` file. See the [ansible-builder EE definition docs](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/builder/en/stable/definition/#dependencies) for more details.

To select MCP servers to install, use the `-e` flag with the `mcp_servers` variable. Servers are selected by their exact role name (e.g., `github_mcp`).

**Example `execution-environment.yml` configuration**:

```yaml
---
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel9:latest
dependencies:
  galaxy: requirements.yml

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf

additional_build_steps:
  append_final: |
    RUN ansible-playbook ansible.mcp_builder.install_mcp -e mcp_servers=github_mcp -e github_mcp_mode=remote

```

Next, run this command inside the directory containing the EE definition file:

```bash
ansible-builder build --tag my-mcp-ee:latest
```

This approach allows you to create custom execution environments with only the MCP servers you need, keeping your container images lean and purpose-built for your specific automation workflows.

### 2. GitHub MCP Server for Repository Automation

Deploy an Execution Environment with the GitHub MCP server to automate GitHub operations through Ansible playbooks. This enables you to create issues, manage pull requests, and interact with repositories programmatically.

**Example workflow**: Build an EE with the GitHub MCP server for automated issue tracking and repository management in CI/CD pipelines. After building the EE, use it to run playbooks that create issues, label pull requests, or manage repository settings.

To run the playbook locally with the EE, use:

```bash
ansible-navigator run github-playbook.yml --eei localhost/my-mcp-ee:latest --ce podman --pp never -m stdout
```


**Authentication**: The GitHub MCP server requires a GitHub token for authentication, which can be passed as an environment variable or parameter when invoking the MCP server.
sible.mcp` collection modules.

### 3. Multi-Cloud Automation with MCP Servers

Combine multiple MCP servers for comprehensive cloud and version control automation. For example, deploy an EE with GitHub MCP (Go binary or remotely hosted), Azure MCP (npm package), and AWS Core MCP (PyPI package) to manage resources across different platforms from a single Ansible workflow.

**Example use case**: Create a deployment pipeline that:
- Perform operations using the AWS Core MCP server's available proxy servers
- Configures Azure resources using the Azure MCP server
- Updates GitHub repository settings and creates deployment issues using the GitHub MCP server

All of these operations can be orchestrated from a single Ansible playbook running in your custom execution environment.


## Testing

This collection has been tested in the following environments:

- **Execution Environments**: Built with `ansible-builder` 3.x
- **Container Runtimes**: Podman 4.x, Docker 24.x
- **Operating Systems**: RHEL 8 - 9
- **Ansible Core versions**: 2.16+ - 2.20+
- **Python versions**: 3.10-3.13

### Testing Process
